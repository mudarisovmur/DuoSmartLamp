Introduction:
Hello. This is a pet project of a young engineer-programmer, and all the comments are welcome.

About:
The main aim of DuoSmartLamp is to connect people in unusual way. 
By the light messages owners could send the light color to each other.
Also the device could play few(at this moment) color animations and lightmusic(3 different modes).

Hardware:
Files from folder hardware could be open by EasyEda tool.
Files from lamp_case were made by Compas 3D and created for 3d print.

Software:
The project was started in mar—Åh 2019, since I passed the cources of c++, 
and only then I realized that the code is compitely awful, but anyway it works.

The electronic circuit as well as assembly instruction will coming not quite soon, 
so if you're interested in this project don`t hesitate to write me to mudarisovmur@gmail.com
At this moment I`m waiting for the boards to be delivered from jlcpcb factory.
